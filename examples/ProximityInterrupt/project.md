Read proximity with interrupt from APDS-9960
===============================

This example was written from this example of the sparkfun https://github.com/sparkfun/APDS-9960_RGB_and_Gesture_Sensor

Tests the proximity interrupt abilities of the APDS-9960. Configures the APDS-9960 over I2C and waits for an external interrupt based on high or low proximity conditions. Move your hand near the sensor and watch the LED on pin LED1.
